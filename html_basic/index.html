<p>After a year of massive cuts, the tech job market is so unstable that the US government has come to be seen as an appealing, innovative employer.

    <p>This is a great nexus point where the need and capacity is out there,” says Keith Wilson, the talent engagement manager with US Digital Response, a nonprofit that helps governments with digital expertise. “We’re trying to help these state and local governments learn how to hire better for technical roles.”
  Case in point: The US Department of Veterans Affairs, which has hired 1,068 people into tech jobs over the past year, meeting its hiring goal, says Nathan Tierney, chief people officer for the department. To do so, the agency adjusted pay to narrow the gap between government and private sector roles, resulting in an average salary increase of $18,000—and nearly all workers across the department got raises.
       <p>It also reworked its application and recruiting strategies; rather than wait for workers to come to the hiring website, it went to find them at LinkedIn Live events and conferences. The department also advertises remote roles, and it is setting up hubs for workers in cities where tech workers congregate, like Seattle, Austin, and Charlotte. “I want to hire highly skilled folks,” Tierney says. “We have an opportunity to capitalize on that.”</p>
